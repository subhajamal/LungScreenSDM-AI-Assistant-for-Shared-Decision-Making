        "combined_text": "Note: The Overview section summarizes the published evidence on this topic. The rest of the summary describes the evidence in more detail.\n\nOther PDQ summaries containing information related to lung cancer screening include the following:\n\nTwo randomized trials have reported statistically significant reductions in lung cancer mortality associated with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening. One trial reported that screening higher-risk individuals (30+ pack-years and either current smokers or quit within the past 15 years) aged 55 to 74 years three times, once annually, with LDCT reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8%–26.7%;P= .004)  and all-cause mortality by 6.7% (95% CI, 1.2%–13.6%;P= .02) over screening with chest radiographs.[1] An updated analysis showed that the estimated reduction in lung  cancer mortality was 16% (95% CI, 5%–25%).[2] The other trial reported that among high-risk current and former smokers, men who were randomly assigned to four rounds of LDCT screening had a 24% reduction (95% CI, 6%–39%) in lung cancer mortality, compared with men who were randomly assigned to no screening.[3]\n\nMagnitude of Effect: About 20% to 24% relative reduction in lung cancer–specific mortality.\n\nFalse-positive rates with LDCT screening have been high, although the magnitude of the rates varies with the definition of a positive screen.[1,4] False-positive exams may result in unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures.\n\nMagnitude of Effect: Two large randomized trials, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the Nederlands–Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek Trial (NELSON), found that the average false-positive rate per screening round was 23.3% and 10.4%, respectively.[1,3,4] Using a more recent definition of a positive LDCT screening on the basis of the Lung-RADS criteria yields a false-positive rate that may be somewhat lower than that seen in the NLST.[4] A total of 0.06% of all false-positive  screening results in the NLST led to a major complication after an invasive procedure was performed as a diagnostic follow-up to the screening. Over three screening rounds, 1.8% of NLST  participants who did not have lung cancer had an invasive procedure after a positive screening result.\n\nBased on fair evidence, some lung cancers detected by LDCT screening appear to represent overdiagnosed cancer. However, estimates of overdiagnosis rates, derived typically by using data from randomized trials of LDCT screening, vary greatly. Therefore, the magnitude of overdiagnosis with LDCT screening is not clear. Overdiagnosed cancers result in unnecessary diagnostic procedures and also lead to unnecessary treatment. The harms of diagnostic procedures and treatment occur at the highest rate among long-term and/or heavy smokers because of smoking-associated comorbidities that increase risk propagation.\n\nMagnitude of Effect: Uncertain.\n\nBased on solid evidence, screening with chest x-ray and/or sputum cytology does not reduce mortality from lung cancer in the general population or in ever-smokers.\n\nMagnitude of Effect: Not applicable.",

This is equivalent to approximately three fewer deaths per 1,000 people screened in the CT group compared to the chest X-ray group over a period of about 7 years of observation (17.6 per 1,000 versus 20.7 per 1,000, respectively).\n\nOn average over the three rounds of screening exams, 24.2 percent of the low-dose helical CT screens were positive and 6.9 percent of the chest X-rays were positive. In both arms of the trial, the majority of positive screens led to additional tests.\n\nAdenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas were detected more frequently at the earliest stage by low-dose helical CT compared to chest X-ray. Small-cell lung cancers, which are very aggressive, were infrequently detected at early stages by low-dose helical CT or chest X-ray.\n\nNLST enrolled 53,454 current or former heavy smokers ages 55 to 74. Participants were required to have a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years and were either current or former smokers without signs, symptoms, or history of lung cancer.

By the time lung cancer is diagnosed, the disease has often already spread outside the lung. Researchers have sought to develop better methods to screen for lung cancer in high-risk populations before symptoms appear, but as with many technologies, refinements are needed.\n\nLow-dose computerized tomography (CT) screening has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality. TheNCI-supported National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)showed that routine, annual screening of heavy smokers with low-dose CT lowered the chance of dying from lung cancer. However, the screening resulted in a large number of false-positive results , which required follow-up with additional imaging procedures, and sometimes invasive procedures such as lung biopsies to rule out cancer.\n\nIt is anticipated that artificial intelligence (AI) – the use of computer programs, or algorithms, that use data to make decisions or predictions – can substantially reduce the false positive rate of low-dose CT screening while minimally affecting test sensitivity, thereby reducing diagnostic uncertainty. For AI research to be an effective tool for lung cancer screening, high-quality image databases are needed.\n\nTo address this gap, NCI is supporting a project to create a library of low-dose CT images and corresponding data related to screening for lung cancer. Overall coordination is being supported by Booz Allen Hamilton under a larger umbrella contract with NCI for collection of medical images and data related to cancer screening.\n\nTo create this library, NCI identified several institutions across the United States that will collect low-dose CT screening and diagnostic follow-up chest CT images, along with associated clinical and demographic data. These institutions will provide geographic variation and demographic variety, along with a range of CT manufacturers.\n\nThe images will be freely available to the scientific community starting around the end of 2025.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute\n\nNCI Division of Cancer Prevention\n\nDCP Home\n\nContact DCP",

Evaluating screening requires weighing risks and benefits.  Monetary cost and cost-effectiveness are not considered when evaluating the evidence.   Levels of\nevidence are assigned when evaluating screening tests.\n\nIn general, the benefit of cancer screening derives from detecting cancer in earlier and more treatable stages, and thereby, reducing mortality from cancer. In addition, for some cancer types and screening modalities, such as endoscopic screening for colorectal cancer and Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for cervical cancer, screening can also prevent the occurrence of cancer by identifying and removing cancer precursors. Screening may also reduce cancer morbidity when the treatment for earlier-stage cancer is associated with fewer side effects than the treatment for advanced cancers.\n\nKnown harms from screening include the following:[1]\n\nBecause screening tests themselves are generally noninvasive, immediate harms from the test are typically minor. Colonoscopy is an exception in that it is an invasive test. It also functions as a diagnostic follow-up examination for other colorectal cancer screening modalities, such as a fecal occult blood (FOB) test.\n\nCommonly used screening tests, such as mammography for breast cancer and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer, have false-positive rates per screen in the range of 5% to 10%; with repeat screening, cumulative false-positive rates for these tests are substantially higher.[2-4] Follow-up invasive diagnostic procedures, such as a prostate biopsy, are associated with low but non-negligible risks of complications. For screening tests such as colonoscopy or Pap smears where precursor lesions, in addition to invasive cancer, are targets of the screen, the definition of a false positive is modified from simply a positive screen in an individual without cancer. For example, for cervical cancer screening, a positive Pap smear with an eventual diagnosis of high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) would not be considered a false positive, since HSIL is a target lesion.\n\nOverdiagnosis occurs when screening procedures detect cancers that would never become clinically apparent in the absence of screening. It is a special concern because identification of the cancer does not benefit the individual, while the side effects of diagnostic procedures and cancer treatment may cause significant harm.  The overall harm of overdiagnosis is related to both the frequency of its occurrence, as well as to the downstream consequences of subsequent treatment. For example, in prostate cancer screening with PSA, there is a high rate of overdiagnosed disease and the harms of curative treatment, including impotence and urinary incontinence, are relatively common, serious, and long-lasting. Therefore, overdiagnosis is a major source of harms in PSA screening.[5] Some of the harms of overdiagnosis may be mitigated by strategies, such as active surveillance in prostate cancer, that attempt to defer immediate treatment in favor of following patients for any signs of worsening prognosis.\n\nIn general, overdiagnosis is more common in older individuals and those with otherwise limited life expectancy since the slowly growing lesions associated with overdiagnosed cancers have less time to become clinically apparent in such persons. Therefore, attempts have been made to discourage screening beyond certain age ranges; for example, most recommendations for mammography screening exclude women aged 75 or older and those with less than 10 years of life expectancy.[6]\n\nIn developing the cancer screening summaries, the PDQ Screening and Prevention\nEditorial Board uses the following definitions:\n\nThe PDQ does not issue clinical practice guidelines.  Many public health organizations present guidelines for health care and screening activities. Their quality varies widely.  Some rely on systematic reviews of evidence of variable quality. Some are influenced by the professional, financial, and intellectual interests of guideline authors and funders. These may conflict with the primary interest—the overall well-being of the patient.[7-9]\n\nThe highest quality guidelines as assessed by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) are those based on the best systematic reviews as evaluated using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR).",

The risk of complications from thoseinvasive proceduresmay be higher than previously thought, a new study suggests.\n\nBy analyzing information from medical insurance claims of more than 300,000 individuals, researchers estimated that, for people treated in community medical practices or hospitals, the complication rates of such procedures were roughly double those reported among participants in the more controlled clinical trial setting of the NCI-sponsoredNational Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Completed in 2010, NLST was the largest-everrandomized clinical trialof lung cancer screening.\n\nThe findings underline an important message for clinicians, said lead investigator Ya-Chen Tina Shih, Ph.D., a professor of health economics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

While there are differences in details among guidelines—for example, related to recommended age at initiation, frequency of screening, and/or screening modality—guideline organizations are united in their belief that regular and appropriate cancer screening helps save lives. Most cancer screening guidelines are for people at average risk of cancer, with eligibility often based primarily on age. Lung cancer screening, however, is recommended based on smoking history. There also are screening recommendations tailored to those at high risk for breast or colorectal cancer based on personal or family history of cancer. Cancer screening guidelines are for asymptomatic individuals; any person experiencing symptoms consistent with cancer should follow up with a healthcare provider for a diagnostic workup.\n\n\n\nAmerican Cancer SocietyAmerican College of Obstetricians and GynecologistsAmerican College of PhysiciansAmerican College of Radiology and Society of Breast ImagingAmerican Society of Breast SurgeonsNational Comprehensive Cancer NetworkU.S. Preventive Services Task Force\n\nAmerican Cancer SocietyAmerican College of PhysiciansU.S. Preventive Services Task Force\n\nAmerican Academy of Family PhysiciansAmerican Cancer SocietyAmerican College of GastroenterologyAmerican College of PhysiciansNational Comprehensive Cancer NetworkU.S. Preventive Services Task ForceU.S. Multi-Society Task Force for Colorectal Cancer\n\nAmerican Academy of Family PhysiciansAmerican Association for Thoracic SurgeryAmerican Cancer SocietyAmerican College of Chest PhysiciansNational Comprehensive Cancer NetworkU.S. Preventive Services Task Force\n\nNote: This list may not be comprehensive.

Annual lung cancer screenings with low-dose CT scans (LDCT) has been shown to reduce deaths from lung cancer. It catches lung cancer earlier when it is more curable. The steps below will help you know what you can expect from the lung cancer screening process. Each hospital and medical center function a little differently, so you might encounter these steps in a slightly different order.\n\nThe first step is finding out if you meet thehigh-risk criteriafor screening. The criteria are based on your age, smoking history, and additional risk factors. It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if they suggest a screening test. LDCT screening for lung cancer is similar to other screening tests, like mammograms and colonoscopies, and is recommended to be done annually.\n\nDuring this conversation, you will discuss the benefits and risks of lung cancer screening and what you can expect from the process.",

This recommendation nearly doubled the number of individuals eligible for screening by lowering the recommended age range to begin screening to age 50 (from 55) as well as reducing the minimum pack-year smoking history from 30 to 20.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, about 14 million people in the U.S. are at high-risk for lung cancer and should talk to their doctor about getting screened. Those considered high risk under the new criteria include people 50-80 years of age with a 20 or higher pack-year history (people who smoked 1 pack/day for 20 years, 2 packs/day for 10 years etc.) who currently smoke or have quit within the last 15 years.",
